I am a computational scientist working in the intersection of physics, computer science, and chemistry. I am currently employed as a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany. Prior to this, I graduated with my PhD from the same institute under the direct supervision of director Prof Ali Alavi in the electronic structure theory department. My dissertation focused on combining real- and orbital-space methods in quantum chemistry, specifically in the form of the transcorrelated and full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo methods. I am interested in shifting gears in the next step of my career by studying larger systems and/or making a more direct societal impact using my technical knowledge. I am especially in doing this with data-driven methods.

I have a varied-yet-in-depth experience. I hold an honours degree from the University of British Columbia in physics and mathematics with a minor in computer science. With this degree, I also participated in the [co-operative education program](https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/) where I collected valuable exprience doing research in machine learning for physics (atomic physics, polymer sequencing, and STM data analysis) as well as work as a data analyst for the Canadian police. After, I started a PhD in theoretical optical physics (solar cell simulations) at the University of Toronto, but ultimately found out this wasn't for me and switched to the Max Planck Institute to finish a PhD in computational chemistry, where I had previously done a coop work term.
