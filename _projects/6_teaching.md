I am very interested in teaching, but unfortunately my visa here in Germany has
prohibited me from formally teaching here. I do, however, have former experience
teaching undergraduate students at UBC and at the University of Toronto when I
was a PhD student there. I also started a [knowledge-base website](https://github.com/jphaupt/phisquared/tree/gh-pages/_introcompphys) during the
COVID lockdown, but put it on hold for my studies and personal matters.
