During my PhD, I was one of the lead developers of the [https://www2.fkf.mpg.de/alavi/neci/stable/index.html](https://www2.fkf.mpg.de/alavi/neci/stable/index.html)
full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) software. This is a mature,
highly parallelised Fortran library that performs the algorithm and its many different
variants. I was particularly involved in support for the transcorrelated method, as well as
improved coding standards and the introduction of a website (see link above).
