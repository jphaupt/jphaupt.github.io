During my undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia, I participated
in the [Science Co-Op program](https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/). This means that I stopped
my studies to work full-time in partner institutes to gather work experience, and
better inform my career goals. Indeed, this experience led me away from pure maths
(my initial passion) to computational physics/chemistry.

My work placements in reverse-chronological order:

### Machine Learning for Optical Physics

Under the supervision of Prof Kirk Madison at UBC, and with the support of an
NSERC USRA, I performed theoretical research on a quantum pressure standard using
machine learning/statistical techniques (principally, LASSO and dimensionality reduction
with sklean).

### Machine Learning for Polymer Sequencing

Under the supervision of Prof Oleg Yazyev, in collaboration with Prof Aleksandra Radenovic
at EPFL, I worked on DNA/polymer sequencing using TensorFlow and keras. I improved upon a
model that took fixed-length sequences to one that can handle arbitrary-length sequences.

### Machine Learning for Experimental Condensed Matter Physics

Under the supervision of Prof Christian Ast, I worked on prescreening scanneling tunneling
microscopy (STM) images and signals using MATLAB and convolutional neural networks.
This was my first introduction to machine learning and to solid state physics, but I
managed to have a working model by the end of the work term.

### Data Analyst at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police

My first work term was with the RCMP (the national police service of Canada) at their
headquarters in Surrey, BC. I worked on staffing analysis, checking their database to
determine performance metrics (principally response times) and produces staffing analyses
for the heads of the detachments that I studied. I also started a collaboration between
the RCMP and UBC to study this further, though I decided not to stay in the study and
pursued physics instead.
